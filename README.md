## 🎯 Problem Statement

Smart home IoT devices are vulnerable to **deepfake voice/video attacks** where attackers impersonate legitimate users to gain unauthorized access. Traditional security systems simply block suspicious requests, but this approach:
- ❌ Provides no intelligence on attacker methods
- ❌ Alerts attackers that they've been detected
- ❌ Fails to adapt to evolving attack patterns

## 💡 Solution

**SentinelAI** introduces a **multi-agent AI system** with **deception-based defense**:
- ✅ Autonomous detection, decision-making, and defense
- ✅ Honeypot mechanism that deceives attackers
- ✅ Gathers attack intelligence while protecting real devices
- ✅ Explainable AI with real-time decision logging

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1️⃣ **Multi-Agent Intelligence**

| Agent | Role | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Detection** | Analyzes audio/video fingerprints | Confidence score + biometric markers |
| **Decision** | Evaluates threat level | Classification + response strategy |
| **Defense** | Executes autonomous action | Allow / Restrict / Deceive |

### 2️⃣ **Three-Tier Classification**

| Classification | Confidence | Threat Level | Action |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Authentic** | 70-100% | 🟢 Low | ✅ Grant IoT access |
| **Suspicious** | 40-69% | 🟡 Medium | ⚠️ Require 2FA verification |
| **Deepfake** | 0-39% | 🔴 High | 🎭 Activate deception mode |

### 3️⃣ **Deception-Based Defense**

When a deepfake is detected, the system:
1. **Sends fake "success" response** to the attacker
2. **Blocks real IoT device access** (stays secure)
3. **Redirects to honeypot environment** (simulated device)
4. **Logs attack silently** for forensic analysis
5. **Studies attacker behavior** to improve future detection

### 4️⃣ **Real-Time Transparency**

- Live agent logs showing decision-making process
- Confidence score visualization
- Threat level indicators
- Defense action tracking

## 🧠 How It Works

### Detection Algorithm

```python
# Simplified logic (actual implementation uses ML models)
def detect_deepfake(audio_file):
    # 1. Extract features
    biometric_markers = extract_voice_fingerprint(audio_file)
    spectral_patterns = analyze_frequency_spectrum(audio_file)
    
    # 2. Compare with baseline
    authenticity_score = compare_with_user_profile(biometric_markers)
    
    # 3. Generate confidence
    confidence = calculate_confidence(authenticity_score, spectral_patterns)
    
    return confidence  # 0-100%
```

### Decision Logic

```python
def make_decision(confidence):
    if confidence >= 70:
        return "AUTHENTIC", "allow"
    elif confidence >= 40:
        return "SUSPICIOUS", "restrict"
    else:
        return "FAKE", "deceive"
```

### Defense Actions

| Action | Implementation | User Experience |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Allow** | Send command to real IoT device | Door unlocks normally |
| **Restrict** | Trigger 2FA authentication | "Please verify identity" prompt |
| **Deceive** | Route to honeypot, log attack | Attacker sees fake "Door unlocked" |

## 💻 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
Node.js >= 16.x
npm >= 8.x
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentinelai-iot-security.git
cd sentinelai-iot-security

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### Demo Usage

1. **Upload Test Files**:
   - `real_voice_command.mp3` → Should show AUTHENTIC
   - `fake_deepfake_audio.mp3` → Triggers DECEPTION MODE
   - `suspicious_audio.wav` → Shows RESTRICTED

2. **Watch Agent Logs**: Observe real-time decision-making process

3. **View Results**: See confidence score, threat level, and defense action

## 🔬 Why This Matters

### Traditional Approach ❌
```
Attacker → Deepfake Command → System Blocks → Attacker Knows Detection → Evolves Attack
```

### SentinelAI Approach ✅
```
Attacker → Deepfake Command → System Deceives → Attacker Thinks Success → 
System Learns Attack Pattern → Improves Future Detection
```

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Autonomous Operation** | No human intervention required |
| **Intelligence Gathering** | Learn from every attack attempt |
| **Attack Deterrence** | Wastes attacker time and resources |
| **Zero Trust Architecture** | Verify every command regardless of source |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Explainable AI decisions for audit trails |
